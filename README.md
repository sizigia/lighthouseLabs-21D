# 21 Days of Code
## Introduction
Once in a while [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) organizes coding challenges in JavaScript. I like to participate as it's a great way to improve my skills and try new things once a day.

This time I'm implementing BDD to test my functions, that said, I wrote the tests myself. Feel free to PR if you see anything that could be improved. Thanks!

## [What is the 21-Day Coding Challenge?](https://coding-challenge.lighthouselabs.ca/about)
Did you know that 95% of websites are built with JavaScript?

JavaScript is one of the most in-demand skills for professional developers and coding hobbyists alike. But building a new skill is difficult. When it comes to coding, perhaps you've already tried to learn on your own. Maybe you started an online tutorial and stopped the lessons after a few days, only to return a few weeks later and find you had forgotten everything! To truly gain a new skill, you need to dive in and give your brain a chance to build muscle memory. To make real progress, you need to commit to practice coding every day.

That’s why Lighthouse Labs created the 21-Day Coding Challenge. In just 15-30 minutes a day, you can build your JavaScript skills and start a daily habit of coding practice. It’s fun, free, and there are fabulous prizes up for grabs.
